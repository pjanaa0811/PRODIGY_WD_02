The Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application is an interactive browser-based game developed using core frontend web technologies. This project was created as part of an internship task to practice implementing game logic, user interaction, and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript.

The application allows two players to take turns and play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game through a simple and engaging interface.

⚙️ How It Works

The game board is created using HTML elements styled with CSS.

The program checks for winning combinations after each move.

When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, the result is displayed.

The game can be restarted without refreshing the page.
